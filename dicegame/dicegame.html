    <h1>Ready to play Bunco?</h1>
    <p>Bunco is a game played with 9 dice. This is a team based game. The goal is to roll the exact 
        amount of dice that matches the round of play you are on. So, if you are on round two, your goal is roll at least 
        two "2"s. Every team gets a roll per round. When the numbers and amount of dice match, that is when you say 
        "BUNCO!" and you earn a point. Whoever has the most points by round nine wins! Have fun!
